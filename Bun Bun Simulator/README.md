This is a per tool pebble wiper that has the BOM fo only a spring

If you plan on modifying this to fit another printer, know that some tilt/flex is a good thing if you plant to use the wiping moving block (Block.stl) as a brush to hit the tip of the nozzle too as it has chamfers to rub on the nozzles and some flex helps. however this isn't necessary and you can always add a silicone brush at the end

The extension spring I used:
Length without hooks: 25mm
inside diameter: 5mm
Material: carbon steel?

That's all I could find, you could also find something slightly weaker and  put it on both sides to insure that the pellets won't hit the spring? I haven't had issues so far tho.
the springs need to stretch 13-14mm and be left a bit stretched still in their "relaxed" poisition. so in total they need 15-18mm~ of travel

To assemble, Put lubrication compatible with your Block.stl (expect for any Nylon/acetal which doesn't need it) on all faces the block moves on expect the top one.
Put Kapton tape on where the pebble will be purged with some aluminium foil/tape under.
Put aluminium foil where the pellet/nozzle would touch to reduce the chance of adhesion.

here's mine:
