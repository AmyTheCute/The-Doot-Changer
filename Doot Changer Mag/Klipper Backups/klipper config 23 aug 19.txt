## Configure a TMC2208 (or TMC2224) stepper motor driver via single
# wire UART. To use this feature, define a config section with a
# "tmc2208" prefix followed by the name of the corresponding stepper
# config section (for example, "[tmc2208 stepper_x]"). This also
# creates a "tmc2208_stepper_x:virtual_enable" virtual pin which may
# be used as the stepper's enable_pin (for enabling the driver via a
# UART message).

[tmc2208 stepper_x]
uart_pin: ar20
#   The pin connected to the TMC2208 PDN_UART line. This parameter
#   must be provided.
#tx_pin: ar20
#   If using separate receive and transmit lines to communicate with
#   the driver then set uart_pin to the receive pin and tx_pin to the
#   transmit pin. The default is to use uart_pin for both reading and
#   writing.
#select_pins:
#   A comma separated list of pins to set prior to accessing the
#   tmc2208 UART. This may be useful for configuring an analog mux for
#   UART communication. The default is to not configure any pins.
microsteps: 16
#   The number of microsteps to configure the driver to use. Valid
#   values are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256. This parameter must
#   be provided.
#interpolate: True
#   If true, enable step interpolation (the driver will internally
#   step at a rate of 256 micro-steps). The default is True.
run_current: 0.81
#   The amount of current (in amps) to configure the driver to use
#   during stepper movement. This parameter must be provided.
hold_current: 0.4
#   The amount of current (in amps) to configure the driver to use
#   when the stepper is not moving. The default is to use the same
#   value as run_current.
#sense_resistor: 0.110
#   The resistance (in ohms) of the motor sense resistor. The default
#   is 0.110 ohms.
#stealthchop_thres hold: 0
#   The velocity (in mm/s) to set the "stealthChop" threshold to. When
#   set, "stealthChop" mode will be enabled if the stepper motor
#   velocity is below this value. The default is 0, which disables
#   "stealthChop" mode.
