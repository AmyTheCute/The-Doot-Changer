# The-Doot-Changer
Files and designs for The Doot Changer
Welcome to the official page for the Doot Changer Project! Keep in mind that Doot Changer Twist is still in alpha and although this version is working well you should build it at risk


**WARNING**: Doot Changer Twist is missing some files. Contact me at Twitter: https://twitter.com/AmyTheBun to get the files, they're unoptimized and therefore not published. They'll be re-designed and published very soon

Doot Changer Mag Is well tested with bowden tools.


The Doot Changer project is aiming to bring tool changing to the average hobbyists to encourage creative tool design and so on. The Doot Changer Mag is well tested with bowden tools and slightly tested with directdrive tools.


Doot Changer Mag barely costs 20$ in BOM and can be added very easily to any existing printer that moves the hotend in both the X and Y axis. the assembly is very easily and the Y Axis space reducion is dependant on the printer. Expect 50-100mm of y axis loss.
Doot Changer Mag is also self aligning and generally more trouble free, upon crashes the tool is more likely to just fall and if the docks aren't aligned it'll pick itself up. Subtractive tools aren't tested yet. Only bowden tools are tested extensively and directdrive tools are only simulated by attaching weights to the bowden tools (300g) at 1200 accel
The Doot Changer Mag motion system is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if you're using a HEVO for a faster printing speed and higher print quality. Currently you'd need to design your Own cariage to make it work with Mag but it should be very easy.


Doot Changer Twist is an entire 3DPrinter that costs 600-800$ depending on your config with 2 tools. the "Sweet spot" config costs 750$ on aliexpress with 2 trianglelab BMG + V6 tools, Robodigg Rails and a tooling plate + a 220v AC heated bed.
Doot Changer Twist uses a Motor (Right now, 28-BYJ-48, Soon it'll switch to a no-name toy DC motor) to lock the tools. therefore to unlock the tools you'd have to break the plastic components. This tool changer changer is far less forgiving to mistakes but has a stronger lock.
The docks for this tool changer also take less space but there are more compact docks potentially in work for the Doot Changer Mag. This printer mainly uses dowel pins and you can use Acetal filament for the wedge.
This printer is also a 150$ upgraede (1 additional trinaglelab tools with extruders) for any existing HEVO and reduces anywhere from 80-100mm of Y Axis usable print volume due to the tools taking space. if building a Doot Changer from scratch simply increase the Y axis by 100-110mm and the x axis by 10-20mm (to make space for potential endstop auto nozzle calibrations and accessories) The rods should remain the same size as well as the X axis rails, However a rod holder will need to be designed (ask me for help!)


This project took a year and made my skin bleed, took all my time and cost me more than 1500$ of prototype and researching. I put my heart into this project and chose to use easily sourcable materials so everyone can enjoy what I enjoy.
Please consider donating to this open source project with Crypto Currency or gift cards, I live in Iran so there are no other options for donations sadly. I'm HOPEFULLY moving to canada by next year. I plan to design a far better printer there if I get free time!
Do message me if you decide to donate so I can squeak out loud very hard ;3 (never made a penny before!)

Update!: Thanks to awesome Anya (https://twitter.com/_Iyalei?s=09) for being the first doot changer donator ^~^ bunny heart is truly molten and warm enough to print PEEK
