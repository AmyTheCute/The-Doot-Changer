This is printer mostly a modified HEVO but the actual tool changer is super modular and works with anything that moves the toolhead in both X and Y. A ton of credit goes to scott3d tech2c and other people I mentioned in the thingiverse page! Thank you all lovely people!

It's based of my HEVO. The stock build is MOSTLY for bowden but will work for direct drives potentially (limited testing). to make it work with dremels or heavier tools use the small circular hole for an additional magnet (it's only an indicator of where to put it, make it larger and use a ring magnet. keep in mind that if you want to add this YOU MUST NOT LET THE TWO MIDDLE MAGNETS TOUCH each other, put atleast 0.2mm or more space between the two, don't make it way too far tho. Magnets lose strengh quickly when too far apart)

my doot changer 2.0 is in the works, it's going well. I probably will at least ad the motion system as an addon here, it's much better than the stock one. plus it frees up the space lost to the docks
