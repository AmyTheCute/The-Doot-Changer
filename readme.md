This is the Github page for The Doot Changer

This is mostly a modified HEVO a ton of credit goes to scott3d tech2c and other people I mentioned in the thingiverse page! Thank you all lovely people!

It's based of my HEVO, Improved and has a Low Weight Tool Changer (Have some ideas in my head that'll make it be able to pick heavy tools) I haven't tried direct drive on it yet but it looks like it can handle it just well IMO


EDIT: V2.0 Is out! it's very experimental. but it doesn't need anything for aligning anymore :)


EDIT: V0.9 i made some very near improvments and it's working great now :) also since i added "drool catchy" you don't need a wipe tower anymore.

 the V2.0 is delayed due the virus but once it arrives I plan on changing the magnets to a spherical type and changing the other side to dowel pins effectively removing the need for 3d printed pins and it'll mean that i'll have a durable long lasting metal coupling!
 
 I also have ordered MGN12C rails so it'll give me a lot more space on the carriage to work with! sadly that'll mean I have to pretty much redesign everything... and I'm planning on moving the motors to the outside of the frame too. that way if I'm right i'll gain near 20mm of added print space!
 
 I also added mirrored versions of the dock so you can save space by putting two next to each other


TODO>:

Design motion systme for mgn12c for x

make the dock have pins coming out form both sides for space efficiency

Sphere magnets and pins or block magnets used as coupling (in progress)
