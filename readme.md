This is mostly a modified HEVO a ton of credit goes to scott3d tech2c and other people I mentioned in the thingiverse page! Thank you all lovely people!

It's based of my HEVO, Improved and has a Low Weight Tool Changer (Have some ideas in my head that'll make it be able to pick heavy tools) I haven't tried direct drive on it yet but it looks like it can handle it just well IMO (based on horrible testing)

my doot changer 2.0 is in the works, it's going well. I probably will at least ad the motion system as an addon here, it's much better than the stock one. plus it frees up the space lost to the docks




TODO>:

Design motion systme for mgn12c for x (In progress)

Tilting hotends with a single extruder in direct drive mode, with a single 12g servo  (In progress after the new motion system)

make the dock have pins coming out form both sides for space efficiency

~~Sphere magnets and pins or block magnets used as coupling (in progress)~~ DONE!
