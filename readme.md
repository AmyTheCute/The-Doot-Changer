This is the Github page for The Doot Changer

This is mostly a modified HEVO a ton of credit goes to scott3d tech2c and other people I mentioned in the thingiverse page! Thank you all lovely people!

It's based of my HEVO, Improved and has a Low Weight Tool Changer (Have some ideas in my head that'll make it be able to pick heavy tools) I haven't tried direct drive on it yet but it looks like it can handle it just well IMO
